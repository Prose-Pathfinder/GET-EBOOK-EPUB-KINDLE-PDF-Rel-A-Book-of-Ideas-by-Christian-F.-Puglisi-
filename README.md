Rel√¶: A Book of Ideas by Christian F. Puglisi Book Review

Name: Dan Perlman
Rating: 4.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Enjoyable and interesting
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2018
Review: Interesting ideas, a nice story about how he and his restaurant got where they are. A little stiff in the writing and a little too much "I thought of this first" kind of feeling for thing that probably predated his birth. But enjoyable nonetheless. There are no "recipes" per se - there are descriptions of dishes with general outlines of how they're made, but no proportions or measurements or detailed methods. It's more of a chef's workbook.

Oops - I have to edit this. It was a vagary of the Kindle format - when it hit the end of these chef's workbook notes, it flipped to "rate this book" as if it was over. I was about to delete it when I realized that it showed I was only 60% of the way through the book - I went back into it, and all the recipes are there, detailed, as an appendix, which the Kindle format had coded as outside the text of the book. So, there are recipes!

Title: But this book is far and away my favorite cookbook, so I felt compelled
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2017
Review: This is my first book review. I don't really write reviews for much of anything. But this book is far and away my favorite cookbook, so I felt compelled.

If you're looking for a book with simple recipes, this isn't the book for you. Heck, even if you are looking for recipes, this book might not be for you. But when you approach this book as a chef's toolkit rather than a cookbook in the traditional sense, you'll find so much value from every page. I use this book for inspiration: how can we manipulate the simplest ingredients to form something amazing? I typically will find an ingredient in my pantry, search the appendix of this book for examples of its use and/or Puglisi's thoughts on the ingredient, and get experimenting.

This book explains the 'why' as much as the 'what', so it equips you to be creative even after you've put the book down. If that sounds like what you're looking for, then don't hesitate. Plus, it's a beautiful coffee table book.

Title: A must buy. Packed with incredible information. A truly unique cook book and an important one.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2014
Review: I can't believe the amount of information in it for the price.

It starts with some general essays about his philosophy and restaurant history, then there are 175 pages of essays on everything from how he uses different textures, to meats, water (benefit of filtered water vs. tap for example), influences, land, ways he manipulates things, and it goes on and on. Every topic gets a page write up. Then he puts the recipes and page numbers at the bottom that deal with the topic (idea) he is referring to.

Then he gets to the dishes. He write a page or so on every dish, explaining its process, influence, and whatever else is applicable. I think an experienced cook could cook from the essays he writes on each dish (kinda like the l'Astrance cookbook). There are about 70 dishes.

After all of this, he then gives you detailed recipes for every dish he just wrote about. All 70 or so with weight measurements and very specific details. Every recipe also comes with a thumbnail of the dish so you can also remember what it looks like without needing to flip back and forth.

This book is probably set up better than almost any other book I have. So much information, laid out so clearly (the ideas section even has those half moons cut outs on the sides of the pages to help you flip to a section, like a big dictionary would have to help you find the letter you are looking for). This book is over 400 pages and every page is packed. Very little extra photographs of stuff for the sake of looking artsy.

Ability to cook from it? Sourcing some ingredients may be a challenge, but I'm willing to give that a pass as the amount of inspiration and knowledge in the book is enough to directly affect my cooking of any dish almost immediately (once I take the time to really sit down and read it/take notes). The Thermomix is used a lot, but every time I've seen it used so far it is just used as a blender (purees, etc., no heating element, but I'm sure that occurs in places).

I don't see any reason not to buy this. I never bought the NOMA cookbook as I don't see how much it would give back to me aside from plating inspirations (which I can Google image if I need to), but this book, while also from Copenhagen and dealing with some more local (but not nearly as locally centered as NOMA) ingredients, gives so much back to the reader that it truly isn't something I would be comfortable listing as a negative.

Review: What a wonderful inspiration to learn from and explore with my own food and cooking.

Going through this book is an experience with the way it is laid out.

While I am an avid home cook I do plan on using the recipes more of how it will influence my own cooking more so than following the recipes - so I will say that this resource is to help with my own creative journey with food and cooking more so than what I will feed my family with.

Title: A revelation
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2014
Review: More than a book about food, an extraordinary life companion. The alternative title could be "Zen and the art of food". With "Tartine Bread", this book is one of the few I like to read randomly, just to remember that details are everything, and that the simplest things can also be the most difficult to grasp, and the most rewarding to accomplish.

Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2014
Review: This is a book to inspire chefs and food lovers. Some of his combinations like green strawberries with new potatoes may not sound that interesting to some but this is a book to inspire you to find your own ideas. It is written in a manner similar to El Bulli and that would not surprise as he worked there and Noma as well. If you want to learn how to balance a dish I highly recommend this book.

Title: Rel√¶ is one of the best cookbooks I have ever owned
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2014
Review: I own a lot of cookbooks, and I do mean a lot. I also cook for a living. Rel√¶ is one of the best cookbooks I have ever owned. It's literally a book if ideas. It's fascinating to read books like this that allow you to get inside the chef's thought process. The way the book is divided into ideas, dishes, and recipes is unique and allows for easy cross referencing back and forth while generating ideas of your own. If you are a serious cook, you need this book.
